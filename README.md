# Social-Network-Analysis-Project
This project analyzes a social network dataset using graph algorithms. It builds an undirected weighted graph, implements Dijkstraâ€™s and A* for shortest paths, and applies dynamic programming to find the longest increasing chain of influence. The goal is to uncover key connections and influence propagation in the network.
